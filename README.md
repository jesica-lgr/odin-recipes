# Recipes Webpage

This is the first project of the *Foundations Course* of The Odin Project. The main topics put into practice in this exercise were git, the html boilerplate, headings and lists, links to other pages, and images.

This basic webpage contains two of my favorite recipes: 

* Spinach and Turkey Lasagna
* Dark Chocolate Marbled Banana Bread with Greek Yogurt


***Enjoy!***
